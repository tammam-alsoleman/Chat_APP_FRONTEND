## ‚ú® Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Single codebase for both Android and iOS using Flutter.
- **Secure Communication:**
    - **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** All text messages transfers are encrypted. The server has no ability to read message content.
    - **Secure Key Exchange:** Utilizes RSA for the secure exchange of symmetric AES keys for group chats.
- **Real-time Messaging:** Instant message delivery and status updates powered by Socket.io.
- **High-Quality Calls:** Peer-to-peer (P2P) video and audio calls built with WebRTC, ensuring low latency and privacy.
- **User Presence:** Real-time online/offline status indicators for contacts.
- **Modern Architecture:** Built following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern for a clean, scalable, and testable codebase.
- **State Management:** Uses the `Provider` package for efficient and simple state management.

- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- An editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- A running instance of the [backend server](https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo-link). *(<- IMPORTANT: Link to your backend repository here)*

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tammam-alsoleman/Chat_APP_FRONTEND.git
    cd Chat_APP_FRONTEND
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Configure the environment:**
    - Open the file `lib/core/config.dart`.
    - Update the `baseUrl` for the `development` environment to point to your local backend server's IP address and port.
    ```dart
    case Environment.development:
      baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS:5000';
      break;
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
